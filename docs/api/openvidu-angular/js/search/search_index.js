to add more extra panels to the PanelComponent. In this example we add a new\npanel alongside the default ones.\nTo mimic the toggling behavior of the default panels, we need to add a new button in the ToolbarComponent\nusing the ToolbarAdditionalPanelButtonsDirective.\nYou can run the associated tutorial here.\n\n    \n        \n            360\n        \n        \n            star\n        \n    \n    \n        \n            NEW PANEL\n            This is my new additional panel\n        \n        \n            NEW PANEL 2\n            This is other new panel\n        \n    \n\n\nWe need to subscribe to the panelOpenedObs Observable to listen to the panel status and update our boolean variables\n(showExternalPanel and showExternalPanel2) in charge of showing or hiding them.\nexport class AdditionalPanelsDirectiveComponent implements OnInit {\n\n    sessionId = \"toolbar-additionalbtn-directive-example\";\n    tokens!: TokenModel;\n\n    showExternalPanel: boolean = false;\n

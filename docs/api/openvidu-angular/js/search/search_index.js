ToolbarAdditionalPanelButtonsDirective.\nYou can run the associated tutorial here.\n\n    \n        \n            360\n        \n        \n            star\n        \n    \n    \n        \n

*ovChatPanel directive allows to replace the default chat panel template with a custom one.\nIn the example below we replace the chat template in a few lines of code.\nYou can run the associated tutorial here.\n\n    \n        Chat\n        \n            \n                {{ msg }}\n            \n        \n        \n        Send\n    \n\n\nAs we need to get the openvidu-browser Session\nobject for sending messages to others, we can get it from the onSessionCreated event fired by the VideoconferenceComponent\nwhen the session has been created.\nOnce we have the session created, we can use the\nsignal method to send our messages.\nexport class ChatPanelDirectiveComponent {\n\n    sessionId = \"chat-panel-directive-example\";\n    tokens!: TokenModel;\n\n    session!:

our Session, so we use the ParticipantService to subscribe to the required Observables.\nWe'll get the local participant and the remote participants to update our custom participants panel on any

component.\nWith *ovStream directive we can access to the stream object from its context using the let keyword and\nreferencing the stream variable: *ovStream=\"let stream\". Now we can access the StreamModel object.\nYou can run the associated tutorial here.\n\n    \n        \n        {{ stream.participant.nickname }}\n    \nexport class StreamDirectiveComponent {\n\n

applications.\nRequirements:\nYou will need NPM and Angular CLI to serve the Angular app. Check your installation with the following command:\nnpm -v\nng vHow to install it\n\nYou need to install the openvidu-angular library in your Angular application:\n\nnpm install openvidu-angular\n\n\nAlso you need Angular Material. Check the Angular Material documentation for installing it.\n\nConfigure it\nYou need to import the openvidu-angular module in your app.module.ts:\nimport { OpenViduAngularConfig, OpenViduAngularModule } from 'openvidu-angular';\nimport { environment } from 'src/environments/environment';\n\nconst config: OpenViduAngularConfig = {\n    production: environment.production\n};\n\n@NgModule({\n    imports: [\n        ...\n        OpenViduAngularModule.forRoot(config)\n    ]\n})You can also add the default styles in your styles.scss file:\n:root {\n    --ov-primary-color: #303030;\n    --ov-secondary-color: #3e3f3f;\n    --ov-tertiary-color: #598eff;\n    --ov-warn-color: #eb5144;\n    --ov-accent-color: #ffae35;\n    --ov-light-color: #e6e6e6;\n\n    --ov-logo-background-color: #3a3d3d;\n\n    --ov-text-color: #ffffff;\n\n    --ov-panel-text-color: #1d1d1d;\n    --ov-panel-background: #ffffff;\n\n    --ov-buttons-radius: 50%;\n    --ov-leave-button-radius: 10px;\n    --ov-video-radius: 5px;\n    --ov-panel-radius: 5px;\n}How to use it\nOpenVidu team has created a few tutorials to help you to start using OpenVidu Angular components.

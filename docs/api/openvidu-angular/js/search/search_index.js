*ovAdditionalPanels directive allows to add more extra panels to the PanelComponent. In this example we add a new\npanel alongside the default ones.\nTo mimic the toggling behavior of the default panels, we need to add a new button in the ToolbarComponent\nusing the ToolbarAdditionalPanelButtonsDirective.\nYou can run the associated tutorial here.\nExample :\n    \n        \n            360\n        \n        \n            star\n        \n    \n    \n        \n            NEW PANEL\n            This is my new additional panel\n        \n        \n            NEW PANEL 2\n            This is other new panel\n        \n    \n\n\nWe need to subscribe to the panelOpenedObs Observable to listen to the panel status and update our boolean variables\n(showExternalPanel and showExternalPanel2) in charge of showing or hiding them.\nExample :export class AdditionalPanelsDirectiveComponent implements OnInit {\n\n    sessionId = \"toolbar-additionalbtn-directive-example\";\n    tokens!: TokenModel;\n\n    showExternalPanel: boolean = false;\n    showExternalPanel2: boolean = false;\n\n    constructor(\n        private httpClient: HttpClient,\n        private panelService: PanelService\n    ) { }\n\n    async ngOnInit() {\n

{\n        this.panelService.panelOpenedObs.subscribe(\n            (ev: { opened: boolean; type?: PanelType | string }) => {\n                this.showExternalPanel = ev.opened && ev.type ===

this.panelService.togglePanel(type);\n    }\n\n    async getToken(): Promise {\n        // Returns an OpeVidu token\n    }\n\n}\n            \n\n\n\n\n        \n            Metadata\n            \n

*ovChatPanel directive allows to replace the default chat panel template with a custom one.\nIn the example below we replace the chat template in a few lines of code.\nYou can run the associated tutorial here.\nExample :\n    \n        Chat\n        \n            \n                {{ msg }}\n            \n        \n        \n        Send\n    \n\n\nAs we need to get the openvidu-browser Session\nobject for sending messages to others, we can get it from the onSessionCreated event fired by the VideoconferenceComponent\nwhen the session has been created.\nOnce we have the session created, we can use the\nsignal method to send our messages.\nExample :export class ChatPanelDirectiveComponent {\n\n    sessionId = \"chat-panel-directive-example\";\n    tokens!: TokenModel;\n\n    session!: Session;\n    messages: string[] = [];\n\n    constructor(private httpClient: HttpClient) { }\n\n    async ngOnInit() {\n        this.tokens = {\n            webcam: await this.getToken(),\n            screen: await this.getToken(),\n        };\n    }\n\n    onSessionCreated(session: Session) {\n        this.session = session;\n        this.session.on(`signal:${Signal.CHAT}`, (event: any) => {\n            const msg = JSON.parse(event.data).message;\n            this.messages.push(msg);\n        });\n    }\n\n    send(message: string): void {\n        const signalOptions: SignalOptions = {\n            data: JSON.stringify({ message }),\n            type: Signal.CHAT,\n            to: undefined,\n        };\n        this.session.signal(signalOptions);\n    }\n\n    async getToken():

directive allows to replace the default session layout with a custom one.\nAs the deafult StreamComponent needs the participant stream, and as the participants streams extraction is not trivial,\nopenvidu-angular provides a ParticipantStreamsPipe for easy extraction of the stream of each participant. In the example\nbelow you can see that on the HTML template, as the last component of the *ngFor statements (| streams).\nYou can run the associated tutorial here.\nExample :\n    \n        \n            \n                \n            \n            \n                \n            \n        \n    \nWe need to get the participants in our Session, so we use the ParticipantService to subscribe to the required Observables.\nWe'll get the local participant and the remote participants to display their streams in our custom session layout.\nExample :export class LayoutDirectiveComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {\n\n    sessionId = 'layout-directive-example';\n    tokens!: TokenModel;\n\n    localParticipant!: ParticipantAbstractModel;\n    remoteParticipants!: ParticipantAbstractModel[];\n    localParticipantSubs!: Subscription;\n    remoteParticipantsSubs!: Subscription;\n\n    constructor(private httpClient: HttpClient, private participantService: ParticipantService) { }\n\n    async

this.localParticipantSubs.unsubscribe();\n        this.remoteParticipantsSubs.unsubscribe();\n    }\n\n    subscribeToParticipants() {\n        this.localParticipantSubs =

directive allows to replace the default panels with your own custom panels.

Inside of it, we customize\nthe ParticipantsPanelComponent and ChatPanelcomponent using their own directives.\nYou can run the associated tutorial here.\nExample :\n    \n        This is my custom

*ovParticipantPanelItemElements directive we can access the participant object from its context using\nthe let keyword and referencing the participant variable: *ovParticipantPanelItem=\"let

*ovParticipantsPanel directive allows to replace the default participants panel template with a custom one.\nIn the example below we replace the participants template in a few lines of code.\nYou can run the associated tutorial here.\nExample :\n    \n        \n            {{localParticipant.nickname}}\n        \n        \n            {{p.nickname}}\n        \n    \n\n\nWe need to get the participants in our Session, so we use the ParticipantService to subscribe to the required Observables.\nWe'll get the local participant and the remote participants to update our custom participants panel on any change.\nExample :export class ParticipantsPanelDirectiveComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {\n\n    sessionId = 'participants-panel-directive-example';\n    tokens!: TokenModel;\n\n    localParticipant!: ParticipantAbstractModel;\n    remoteParticipants!: ParticipantAbstractModel[];\n    localParticipantSubs!: Subscription;\n    remoteParticipantsSubs!: Subscription;\n\n    constructor(private httpClient: HttpClient, private participantService: ParticipantService) { }\n\n    async ngOnInit() {\n        this.tokens = {\n            webcam: await this.getToken(),\n            screen: await this.getToken()\n        };\n    }\n\n    ngOnDestroy() {\n        this.localParticipantSubs.unsubscribe();\n        this.remoteParticipantsSubs.unsubscribe();\n    }\n\n    subscribeToParticipants() {\n        this.localParticipantSubs = this.participantService.localParticipantObs.subscribe((p) => {\n            this.localParticipant = p;\n        });\n

directive allows to replace the default StreamComponent template injecting a custom one.\nIn the example below we customize the participant's nickname position and styles, replacing the default stream component.\nWith *ovStream directive we can access to the stream object from its context using the let keyword and\nreferencing the stream variable: *ovStream=\"let stream\". Now we can access the StreamModel object.\nYou can run the associated tutorial here.\nExample :\n    \n        \n        {{ stream.participant.nickname }}\n    \nExample :export class StreamDirectiveComponent {\n\n    sessionId = 'toolbar-directive-example';\n    tokens!: TokenModel;\n\n    constructor(private httpClient: HttpClient) { }\n\n    async ngOnInit() {\n

applications.\nRequirements:\nYou will need NPM and Angular CLI to serve the Angular app. Check your installation with the following command:\nExample :npm -v\nng vHow to install it\n\nYou need to install the openvidu-angular library in your Angular application:\n\nExample :npm install openvidu-angular\n\n\nAlso you need Angular Material. Check the Angular Material documentation for installing it.\n\nConfigure it\nYou need to import the openvidu-angular module in your app.module.ts:\nExample :import { OpenViduAngularConfig, OpenViduAngularModule } from 'openvidu-angular';\nimport { environment } from 'src/environments/environment';\n\nconst config: OpenViduAngularConfig = {\n    production: environment.production\n};\n\n@NgModule({\n    imports: [\n        ...\n        OpenViduAngularModule.forRoot(config)\n    ]\n})You can also add the default styles in your styles.scss file:\nExample ::root {\n    --ov-primary-color: #303030;\n    --ov-secondary-color: #3e3f3f;\n    --ov-tertiary-color: #598eff;\n    --ov-warn-color: #eb5144;\n    --ov-accent-color: #ffae35;\n    --ov-light-color: #e6e6e6;\n\n    --ov-logo-background-color: #3a3d3d;\n\n    --ov-text-color: #ffffff;\n\n    --ov-panel-text-color: #1d1d1d;\n    --ov-panel-background: #ffffff;\n\n    --ov-buttons-radius: 50%;\n    --ov-leave-button-radius: 10px;\n    --ov-video-radius: 5px;\n    --ov-panel-radius: 5px;\n}How to use it\nOpenVidu team has created a few tutorials to help you to start using OpenVidu Angular components.

*ovAdditionalPanels directive allows to add more extra panels to the PanelComponent. In this example we add a new\npanel alongside the default ones.\nTo mimic the toggling behavior of the default panels, we need to add a new button in the ToolbarComponent\nusing the ToolbarAdditionalPanelButtonsDirective.\nYou can run the associated tutorial here.\n\n    \n        \n            360\n        \n        \n            star\n        \n    \n    \n        \n

directive allows to replace the default session layout with a custom one.\nAs the deafult StreamComponent needs the participant stream, and as the participants streams extraction is not trivial,\nopenvidu-angular provides a ParticipantStreamsPipe for easy extraction of the stream of each participant. In the example\nbelow you can see that on the HTML template, as the last component of the *ngFor statements (| streams).\nYou can run the associated tutorial here.\n\n    \n        \n            \n

Observables.\nWe'll get the local participant and the remote participants to display their streams in our custom session layout.\nexport class LayoutDirectiveComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy

directive allows to replace the default StreamComponent template injecting a custom one.\nIn the example below we customize the participant's nickname position and styles, replacing the default stream component.\nWith *ovStream directive we can access to the stream object from its context using the let keyword and\nreferencing the stream variable: *ovStream=\"let stream\". Now we can access the StreamModel object.\nYou can run the associated tutorial here.\n\n    \n        \n        {{ stream.participant.nickname }}\n    \nexport class StreamDirectiveComponent {\n\n

applications.\nRequirements:\nYou will need NPM and Angular CLI to serve the Angular app. Check your installation with the following command:\nnpm -v\nng vHow to install it\n\nYou need to install the openvidu-angular library in your Angular application:\n\nnpm install openvidu-angular\n\n\nAlso you need Angular Material. Check the Angular Material documentation for installing it.\n\nConfigure it\nYou need to import the openvidu-angular module in your app.module.ts:\nimport { OpenViduAngularConfig, OpenViduAngularModule } from 'openvidu-angular';\nimport { environment } from 'src/environments/environment';\n\nconst config: OpenViduAngularConfig = {\n    production: environment.production\n};\n\n@NgModule({\n    imports: [\n        ...\n        OpenViduAngularModule.forRoot(config)\n    ]\n})You can also add the default styles in your styles.scss file:\n:root {\n    --ov-primary-color: #303030;\n    --ov-secondary-color: #3e3f3f;\n    --ov-tertiary-color: #598eff;\n    --ov-warn-color: #eb5144;\n    --ov-accent-color: #ffae35;\n    --ov-light-color: #e6e6e6;\n\n    --ov-logo-background-color: #3a3d3d;\n\n    --ov-text-color: #ffffff;\n\n    --ov-panel-text-color: #1d1d1d;\n    --ov-panel-background: #ffffff;\n\n    --ov-buttons-radius: 50%;\n    --ov-leave-button-radius: 10px;\n    --ov-video-radius: 5px;\n    --ov-panel-radius: 5px;\n}How to use it\nOpenVidu team has created a few tutorials to help you to start using OpenVidu Angular components.

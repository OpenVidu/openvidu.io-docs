replace the default chat panel template with a custom one.\nIn the example below we replace the chat template in a few lines of code.\nYou can run the associated tutorial here.\n\n    \n        Chat\n

can get it from the onSessionCreated event fired by the VideoconferenceComponent\nwhen the session has been created.\nOnce we have the session created, we can use the\nsignal method to send our messages.\nexport class ChatPanelDirectiveComponent {\n\n    sessionId = \"chat-panel-directive-example\";\n    tokens!: TokenModel;\n\n    session!: Session;\n    messages: string[] = [];\n\n

*ovStream directive we can access to the stream object from its context using the let keyword and\nreferencing the stream variable: *ovStream=\"let stream\".

ToolbarAdditionalPanelButtonsDirective.\nYou can run the associated tutorial here.\n\n    \n        \n            360\n        \n        \n            star\n        \n    \n    \n        \n

*ovChatPanel directive allows to replace the default chat panel template with a custom one.\nIn the example below we replace the chat template in a few lines of code.\nYou can run the associated tutorial here.\n\n    \n        Chat\n        \n            \n                {{ msg }}\n            \n        \n        \n        Send\n    \n\n\nAs we need to get the openvidu-browser Session\nobject for sending messages to others, we can get it from the onSessionCreated event fired by the VideoconferenceComponent\nwhen the session has been created.\nOnce we have the session created, we can use the\nsignal method to send our messages.\nexport class ChatPanelDirectiveComponent {\n\n    sessionId = \"chat-panel-directive-example\";\n    tokens!: TokenModel;\n\n    session!:

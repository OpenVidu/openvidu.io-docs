ToolbarAdditionalPanelButtonsDirective.\nYou can run the associated tutorial here.\n\n    \n        \n            360\n        \n        \n            star\n        \n    \n    \n        \n

*ovChatPanel directive allows to replace the default chat panel template with a custom one.\nIn the example below we replace the chat template in a few lines of code.\nYou can run the associated

directive allows to replace the default panels with your own custom panels. This directive also allows to insert elements\ntagged with the ChatPanelDirective, ParticipantsPanelDirective and AdditionalPanelsDirective.\nIn the example below we replace the entire PanelComponent using the *ovPanel directive. Inside of it, we customize\nthe ParticipantsPanelComponent and ChatPanelcomponent using their own directives.\nYou can run the associated tutorial here.\n\n    \n        This is my custom chat panel\n

our Session, so we use the ParticipantService to subscribe to the required Observables.\nWe'll get the local participant and the remote participants to update our custom participants panel on any change.\nexport class ParticipantsPanelDirectiveComponent implements OnInit, OnDestroy {\n\n    sessionId = 'participants-panel-directive-example';\n    tokens!: TokenModel;\n\n    localParticipant!:

Simulcast is a technique that allows\nto send multiple versions of the same video stream at different resolutions, framerates and qualities. This way,\nthe receiver can subscribe to the most appropriate stream for its current network conditions.\nIt is only available for VideoconferenceComponent and only if OpenVidu Server was configured to use the\nmediasoup media server. Otherwise, Simulcast will be disabled.\nDefault: false\n\n            \n\n\n            \n                Implements\n            \n            \n                            OnDestroy\n            \n\n\n        \n            Metadata\n            \n                \n\n                    \n                        Selector\n                        ov-videoconference[simulcast]\n                    \n\n                \n            \n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"components/StreamComponent.html":{"url":"components/StreamComponent.html","title":"component - StreamComponent","body":"\n                   \n\n\n\n\n\n  Components\n  \n  StreamComponent\n\n\n\n        \n            Info\n        \n\n\n\n    \n    File\n\n\n    projects/openvidu-angular/src/lib/components/stream/stream.component.ts\n\n\n\n    \n        Description\n    \n    \n        The StreamComponent is hosted inside of the LayoutComponent.\nIt is in charge of displaying the participant video stream in the videoconference layout.\n\n\n API Directives\n\nThis component allows us to show or hide certain HTML elements with the following Angular attribute directives\nwith the aim of fully customizing the StreamComponent.\n\n\n\nParameter\nType\nReference\n\n\n\n\ndisplayParticipantName\nboolean\nStreamDisplayParticipantNameDirective\n\n\ndisplayAudioDetection\nboolean\nStreamDisplayAudioDetectionDirective\n\n\nsettingsButton\nboolean\nStreamSettingsButtonDirective\n\n\nresolution\nstring\nStreamResolutionDirective\n\n\nframeRate\nnumber\nStreamFrameRateDirective\n\n\n\n\nSee all API Directives\n\n\n\n\nOpenVidu Angular Directives\n\nThe StreamComponent can be replaced with a custom component.

applications.\nRequirements:\nYou will need NPM and Angular CLI to serve the Angular app. Check your installation with the following command:\nnpm -v\nng vHow to install it\n\nYou need to install the openvidu-angular library in your Angular application:\n\nnpm install openvidu-angular\n\n\nAlso you need Angular Material. Check the Angular Material documentation for installing it.\n\nConfigure it\nYou need to import the openvidu-angular module in your app.module.ts:\nimport { OpenViduAngularConfig, OpenViduAngularModule } from 'openvidu-angular';\nimport { environment } from 'src/environments/environment';\n\nconst config: OpenViduAngularConfig = {\n    production: environment.production\n};\n\n@NgModule({\n    imports: [\n        ...\n        OpenViduAngularModule.forRoot(config)\n    ]\n})You can also add the default styles in your styles.scss file:\n:root {\n    --ov-primary-color: #303030;\n    --ov-secondary-color: #3e3f3f;\n    --ov-tertiary-color: #598eff;\n    --ov-warn-color: #eb5144;\n    --ov-accent-color: #ffae35;\n    --ov-light-color: #e6e6e6;\n\n    --ov-logo-background-color: #3a3d3d;\n\n    --ov-text-color: #ffffff;\n\n    --ov-panel-text-color: #1d1d1d;\n    --ov-panel-background: #ffffff;\n\n    --ov-buttons-radius: 50%;\n    --ov-leave-button-radius: 10px;\n    --ov-video-radius: 5px;\n    --ov-panel-radius: 5px;\n}How to use it\nOpenVidu team has created a few tutorials to help you to start using OpenVidu Angular components.

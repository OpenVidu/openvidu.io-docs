directive allows to add elements to the ParticipantsPanelItemComponent.\nIn the example below we add a simple button to disconnect from the session.\nWith *ovParticipantPanelItemElements directive we can access the participant object from its context using\nthe let keyword and referencing the participant variable: *ovParticipantPanelItem=\"let participant\".\nNow we can access the ParticipantAbstractModel object and enable the button just for the local participant.\nYou can run the associated tutorial here.\n\n    \n        \n            Leave\n        \n    \n\nSession

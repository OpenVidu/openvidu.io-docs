ToolbarAdditionalPanelButtonsDirective.\nYou can run the associated tutorial here.\n\n    \n        \n            360\n        \n        \n            star\n        \n    \n    \n        \n

*ovParticipantPanelItemElements directive allows to add elements to the ParticipantsPanelItemComponent.\nIn the example below we add a simple button to disconnect from the session.\nWith *ovParticipantPanelItemElements directive we can access the participant object from its context using\nthe let keyword and referencing the participant variable: *ovParticipantPanelItem=\"let participant\".\nNow we can access the ParticipantAbstractModel object and enable the button just for the local participant.\nYou can run the associated tutorial here.\n\n    \n        \n

     \n                The *ovParticipantsPanel directive allows to replace the default participants panel template with a custom one.\nIn the example below we replace the participants template in a

to get the participants in our Session, so we use the ParticipantService to subscribe to the required Observables.\nWe'll get the local participant and the remote participants to update our custom

<h2 id="section-title">What is OpenVidu?</h2>
<hr>

<p style="font-size: 18px; color: #7a7a7a; margin-top: 30px; padding: 4px;">
OpenVidu is a platform to facilitate the addition of video calls in your web or mobile application. It provides a complete stack of technologies very easy to integrate in your application. Our main goal is to allow developers to add real-time communications to their apps very fast and with low impact in their code.

Some use cases
===

<br>
Some interesting use cases you can implement with OpenVidu:

- An integrated 1-to-1 video-call center to attend your customers face to face
- A videoclassroom platform where one or more teachers publish their webcams or desktops and many students receive them
- Audio-only rooms where users can also interact through a chat
- A conference service that allows the presenter to apply audio or video filters in real-time and record the lecture in a video file
- A security platform where you can receive video from security cameras/webcams. You could even receive a notification when some movement is detected in a region of the video
- An application to receive video from drones equipped with a camera <i>(RTSP support coming soon)</i>

The possibilities are endless. You can check our **[Demos](https://openvidu.io/demos){:target="_blank"}** to get an idea of what you can do with OpenVidu. Here some cool pictures of them:

OpenVidu Architecture
===

<p align="center" style="margin-top: 50px; margin-bottom: 50px">
  <img class="img-responsive" style="max-height: 550px;" src="/img/docs/home/openvidu-new-architecture.png">
</p>

OpenVidu is divided into two parts:

  - **OpenVidu Browser**: it is a library to use in your client side (available for JavaScript and TypeScript). It allows you to create video-calls, join users to them, send and receive video and audio, etc... All the actions available with OpenVidu are managed via OpenVidu Browser.
  - **OpenVidu Server**: it is an application that handles the server-side stuff. It receives the operations from OpenVidu Browser and do whatever is necessary to establish and manage your video-calls. You will never have to explicitly use it: just to run it and know its IP address.

----------

Get started
===

These are the recommended steps for getting started with OpenVidu:

1. The best way to get your first app working in a few minutes is following our **[OpenVidu Hello World Tutorial](/tutorials/openvidu-hello-world/){:target="_blank"}**.

2. After that, you can try any of our **[Client-Side-Only](/tutorials/#client-side-only){:target="_blank"}** tutorials, or maybe go straight to step 3 if you think that you already handle OpenVidu reasonably well.

3. Try now any of our **[Client-Side + Server-Side](/tutorials/#client-side-server-side){:target="_blank"}** tutorials, where you can see how a complete web application works with OpenVidu. Choose your preferred framework, since all 4 applications are exactly the same regarding their look and functionality.

4. Finally you can **deploy your first app** and see it working in the real world. You can follow our tutorial, where you can deploy our Demos in your own Amazon machine in a few minutes (**[Deploying OpenVidu Demos on AWS](/deployment/deploying-aws/){:target="_blank"}**). Then you can deploy your own app following these steps (**[Deploying OpenVidu Server](/deployment/deploying-aws/){:target="_blank"}** and **[Deploying your app on AWS](/deployment/deploying-app/){:target="_blank"}**).

How does OpenVidu work?
===

**[WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/){:target="_blank"}** is the ultimate responsible for all media transmission at the very heart of OpenVidu. WebRTC is a modern, cross-platform framework that democratizes media transmission over the Internet. It is promoted by Google, Mozilla, Opera and others.

**[Kurento](http://www.kurento.org/){:target="_blank"}** is the WebRTC framework on which OpenVidu is built. Openvidu was forked from [KurentoRoom project](https://github.com/Kurento/kurento-room){:target="_blank"}.

<div class="row no margin" style="margin-top: 2em; margin-bottom: 2em">
  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <img class="img-responsive" style="max-height: 110px; margin: auto" src="/img/assets/webrtc2.png">
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-6">
    <img class="img-responsive" style="max-height: 130px; margin: auto" src="/img/assets/kurento.png">
  </div>
</div>

What are the differences between Kurento and OpenVidu?

OpenVidu wraps and hides all the low-level operations. The main goal we pursue is to provide a simple, effective, easy-to-use API so you can forget about WebRTC, ICE candidates and media server tricky stuff. We internally use Kurento to generate, connect, modify and destroy media-pipelines, but OpenVidu simplifies as far as possible the process, focusing on the use-case of video-call sessions (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many, users with different roles).

**Ultimately, developers can create video-calls with just a few lines of code, all from their client-side**.

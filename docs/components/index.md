# OpenVidu Components

OpenVidu tries once again to facilitate the development of videoconferencing applications and that is why we have developed a **npm library** (**currently only available for Angular Framework**) that provides the developer with **powerful and complete videoconferencing components** and allows, in a very simple way, to adapt or replace those components to suit your needs.

Our professional and ready to use [OpenVidu Call](https://openvidu.io/openvidu-call) application is developed using **OpenVidu Components**.

### Why OpenVidu Components

OpenVidu's main goal is to **reduce the developer's effort in creating a video conferencing application** to a minimum. With **OpenVidu Components** we try to give you the possibility to develop fully customised applications avoiding low level details and without starting from scratch.

### How can I use it?
We have prepared a very detailed documentation to make it really simple to use this components library. Have a look [here](api/openvidu-angular/).

We have also prepared several tutorials so you can see how it works. The purpose of these tutorials is to help you use the library and they cover everything from customising colours to injecting new features:

* [**openvidu-custom-ui**](components/openvidu-custom-ui/): Shows how customize the UI.

### Is it possible to use it with another frontend technologie?
**Our roadmap is to support most frontend technologies** but for the moment OpenVidu Components is only available for Angular applications.

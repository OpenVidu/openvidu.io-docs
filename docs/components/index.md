# OpenVidu Components

## What is it

OpenVidu Components is a new frontend framework built for making videoconferencing applications for OpenVidu in the simplest possible way. It is an **npm library** (currently only available for **Angular**) that provides the developer **powerful and complete videoconferencing components**. These components can be adapted, extended and replaced very easily to suit your application's needs.

</p>

The main goal always pursued by the OpenVidu team is to reduce to a minimum the developer's effort when creating videoconferencing applications. OpenVidu Components can greatly assist in this goal for the following reasons:

- It avoids having to start from scratch and avoids low-level details. You can have the first version of your application up and running in minutes, and work on your customizations from there.
- It offers as much customization as possible. Adapt, extend and replace any component however you want.
- It keeps your code up to date. Using OpenVidu Components means that your application will be much easier to update after each new OpenVidu release.

Nothing better than a real example to see the potential of OpenVidu Components. Our production-ready flagship application **[OpenVidu Call](https://openvidu.io/openvidu-call)** is developed using OpenVidu Components.
